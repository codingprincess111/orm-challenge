## Installation

Create the database using the schema provided in /db/schema.sql. in a seperate terminal run node seeds/index.js, node run seeds might work on other terminals as well. Then run npm start, and then your application has started.

## Technologies Used

Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize ORM, nodemon, dotenv

### Challenges 

When using Postman, I found it hard to navigate and remember the IDs that were created when using POST request and create a walk through in a timely manner. Insomnia looks easier to navigate vs. Postman.
